# Introduction
This is book notes for "Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition" book.

# Preface
## Why this book?
The purpose of this book is to show the relationship between hardware and software. At least the next decade, most programmers are going to have to understand the hardware/software interface if they want programs to run efficiently on parallel computers.

## Why RISC-V?
* RISC-V, which was developed originally at UC Berkeley, not only cleans up the quirks of the MIPS instruction set, but it offers a simple, elegant, modern take on what instruction sets should look like in 2017.
* There are open-source RISC-V simulators, compilers, debuggers, and so on easily available and even open-source RISC-V implementations available written in hardware description languages.

## Goal
* Demonstrate the importance of understanding modern hardware to get good performance and energy efficiency with a concrete example.
* Help readers separate the forest from the trees by identifying eight great ideas of computer architecture early and then pointing out all the places they occur throughout the rest of the book.
* Recognize he generation change in computing from the PC era to the post-PC era.
* Spread the I/O material throughout the book rather than have it in its own chapter.
