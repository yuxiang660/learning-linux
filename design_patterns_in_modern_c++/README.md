Notes about "Design Patterns in Modern C++" by Dmitri Nesteruk (Apress, 2018).

# Introduction
## The SOLID Design Principles
* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   * For example, split save from Journal class
* Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
   * a type is open for extension but closed for modification
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   * segregate parts of a complicated interface into separate interfaces
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   * high-level module should not depend on low-level modules, should depend on abstractions
   * abstractions should not depend on details
