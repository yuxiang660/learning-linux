# Intro
"C++ Templates - The Complete Guide" (Second Edition) Notes

## About This Book
### Goal
* to provide the definitive guide to C++ templates, including
   * a solid reference
   * an accessible tutorial

## Why Templates?
* If no template,
   * you may have to write general code for a common base type such as `Object`. Then you will lose the benefit of type checking
   * you may have to use a special preprocessor, which might result in strange semantic errors
* If having template,
   * full support of type checking
   * parameterize behavior
   * optimize code
