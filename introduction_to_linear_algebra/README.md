# Preface
## Ax = b
The vector `Ax` is **a combination of the columns of A**.

The solution vector x comes at three levels:
* Direct solution
* Matrix solution
* Particular solution plus nullspace solution

# Introduction to Vectors

## Vectors and Linear Combinations
Linear algebra is built on these operations:
* adding vectors
* multiplying by scalars

We have three ways to describe vector `v`:
* two numbers
* arrow from (0, 0)
* point in the plane

## Lengths and Dot Products
